Hello.

My mind wanders off to **basketball** a lot in the past few days.
Maybe it's the fact that one of the greatest NBA Finals ever to be played just got over .Or maybe it has something to do with my playing the game on a regular basis these past 10 days.

I think a lot about explosiveness and how I can get faster and move quickly off my feet. You might think I'm too entrenched in myself. You might be right.

I never appreciated the ability to burst off from 0-60 in matter of seconds. Two players come to mind that have that ability in spades.*Kyrie Irving* and *Russell Westbrook*, especially the latter one.
 Kyrie has a lot of skill built into his game and combined with the amount of effort he puts in to perfecting his body to undergo the rigors of a regular season bouncing around with freaks of nature demands appreciation. Russell on the other hand is an athletic freak of nature who will break you down physically.
 He reminds me of a quicker , slightly less stronger Lebron in some aspects.

 Anyway, I think jumping jacks and high intensity sprints are the way to go to improve quickness. Along with suicides , this could really boost up my athleticism.
 I'm guessing 10 suicides and 10 sprints should do the trick every day.
 This patched along with driving layups could really turn me into a point guardy type of player.
 I think of myself as a wing player, and I'm looking to change that.

 Might also try to learn the windmill, but then again you need a good jump for that. I wonder whether I can reach 30-35 inches on my vertical..

 Thoughts for another day

 Cheerio
