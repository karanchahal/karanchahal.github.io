Hullo,

Last autumn ,I went on a trekking expedition with 2 of my friends. We went to a place called Beas Kund which is known for its scenic beauty and challenging climbs.

The plan (more accurately, no plan) was made a week before we actually embarked for the journey. It was cancelled the next day. The plan was bought up again 3 days later and promptly discarded.
The last day saw a flurry of decisions and fixes, including but not limited to lying to the parents, buying a haphazard tent and frantically booking the last and coincidentally the cheapest bus to *Manali* . Frantically packing 2 track pants, my tent , a sleeping bag and taking whatever cash was available in my account( a paltry 4000 ruppees) ,I set off to meet my friends.
The air was filled with the promise of adventure and I was determined to meet that sweet mistress head on.
We boarded the local metro and arrived at the bus station with 2 minutes to spare. Frantically searching for our bus we finally spotted it with its engine on and raring to go.
We were in for a surprise as we entered the bus. People. **Lot** of people. the seats were crammed with people who had *bags upon bags* on their laps. We had managed to secure 3 small seats tucked away in the corner of the bus and were set to go. With legs already cramping up(due to the kid size seats) we were off to pursue that flighty temptress, **Adventure** !

After a long overnight bus journey we reached our destination by 8 A.M the next morning. The first thing to do is secure our return tickets and after doing so, we headed out into the small town, Manali.

Manali was a beautiful place with huge snow capped mountains surrounding it from all sides . There was a bustling main market where vendors would sell their wares. However, at that time of the morning, they were simply setting up their shops. We approached a travel agent to inquire about the trek we were about to take.

**
'10,000 ruppees!'<br>
'per person'<br>
'No negotiation'<br>
'And we leave tomorrow'
**

*We didn't like that very much.*


Worried suddenly about whether we would actually do this thing and a little daunted by what to do next,
we began strolling through the market looking for other options. I had read on the internet that porters or guides could be hired for cheap and they could make our food too.
I was reminded of that fact when I saw a fit young man , with mountain ropes around his waist.
We went up to him and told him about our situation.<br>

*
'We want to go to Beas Kund'<br>
*
**
'3000 ruppees, and you'll need to get supplies'<br>
**
*
'What supplies would we need ?'<br>
*
**
'You need one more tent, sleeping bags and tent matresses. Furthermore you'll need to get a stove, kerosene and food supplies if you intend to survive the trip.'<br>
**
*
'Do you know of such a place where we can get this stuff ?'<br>
*
**
'Yes'<br>
**
*
'Brilliant'<br>
*


We set off to the trek supply shop with our new friend and got the needed supplies. We also got a lot of energy bars, a packet of sausages and 10 packets of Maggi(Noodles) to keep us from starving in those inhospitable environment.

Around 12, we took a taxi to the place from where the trek begun and after reaching there. We were **OFF** !

We trudged up a half made road through bare tunnels and through waterfalls, until we reached the foothills of the mountains.
We were a little tired as we had walked for a solid 2 hours with 15 kilograms on our backs no less.

That load seemed to lessen when we reached the mountain we were to climb, with its velvet grass and bubbling stream flowing past.
We walked through this green wonderland till we reached the base camp, where we erected our tents and set up camp for the night.

Night falls early in the mountains and it is absolute. Once the sun goes down, the temperature falls swiftly. We had trouble seeing our hands in the pitch darkness and settled around our little stove that provided a dim flickering light. There was a feeling of companionship and brotherhood in the tent as we made our food(lots of water and noodles). The laughter and stories told numbed the feeling of isolation and the night sped along swiftly.

We woke up early the next morning and silently packed up our belongings and set off for what was the most grueling part of the trek.
The path curved and twisted along with sudden dips and rises in height. This in itself was exhausting for our bodies, but pared with carrying our supplies, it became quite daunting.

We were **living our dreams** though! How good can this get, we're up here in the lap of nature, no responsibilities. Only the goal of reaching the next checkpoint.

 Up there you forget everything.

  Your responsibilities, goals, all of them fade and you just soak in the moment. It is really an intense feeling.

We Crossed little rivlets, ate in the shade of some of the tallest pine trees I had ever seen. We arrived at our destination by 3 p.m and set up camp.
It was beautiful, snow capped mountains were within reach and we climbed up to check them out. We couldn't reach because the path suddenly ended and it became quite dangerous to continue on.
 So, we went back to our camp and met some fellow trekkers . One of them was from Japan and the other from Canada. It was great meeting them and sharing our collective experiences.

As night arrived, we made our dinner and retired to our beds. We promptly feel asleep as we were all very tired.

 The next day we made our way back. The trip down was not nearly as challenging as the trip up, but it was more relaxing. On the way down we jumped into a pool of glacial water. That was a memorable experience too.
 Finally after going past our base camp, we managed to hitch a dirt truck and the driver was kind enough to drop us to Manali, no charge !

 So, we dumped our stuff in the back and climbed onto the back of the truck, which was open from the back I might add.
 We were literally hanging on for our lives as the truck made its way into the valley trying its best to enter the Grand Prix no less.
The air, the views and the breakneck speed. All perfect.
 That might be the best part of the trek in my opinion .


 After making it back to Manali , we had lunch at a pretty cool cafe, Cafe 1947. It had some delicious pasta and the beer wasn't bad at all.

 With those experiences we boarded our bus back home and bid adieu to the trip of our lifetime.
 It was really an experience to remember.
