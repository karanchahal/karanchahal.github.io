Hello.

My name is Karanbir Singh Chahal and I'm a computer engineering student at **NSIT** .


I am a 20 year old **software developer** and I love to code. Building and breaking things has always been a passion of mine and that has translated well into my computer engineering education. I like to think of myself as a product maker and am always on the lookout for new and exciting technologies.
 In the past 3 years of my college education I have tried to be part of a wide variety of diverse projects.I love to take on challenges and am always on the lookout for projects that will push me in fun unexpected ways.

   I love to collaborate but also have no problem building and completing a project by myself. I like to think of myself as a self starter and a highly motivated individual.


My love for **writing** has led me to start a blog where I write about the stuff that interest me. The topics can range from a recent movie I liked to Deep Convolutional Networks.

 Since the 7th grade I have loved the sport of **Basketball** and that love endures. I have played for my school and college basketball teams and indulge in a regular pickup game frequently. I also play an instrument (the guitar) and like to push myself in that area as well. Other hobbies include trekking(I make it a point to at least 2 treks in an year) and reading.

You can find out more about me from my Linked In profile which can be accessed [here](https://in.linkedin.com/in/karanbir-chahal-858268ba).
